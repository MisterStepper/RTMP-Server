Run as https using self signing cert




Step 1: Create a Self-Signed Certificate

You can create a self-signed SSL certificate using the OpenSSL tool. Run these commands on your server:


# Create a private key
openssl genrsa -out selfsigned.key 2048

# Generate a self-signed certificate
openssl req -new -x509 -key selfsigned.key -out selfsigned.crt -days 365 -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"

This command generates a private key (selfsigned.key) and a certificate (selfsigned.crt) that is valid for 365 days. The -subj parameter allows you to specify the certificate's subject directly in the command line, avoiding the need for interactive prompts.
Step 2: Configure Nginx to Use the Self-Signed Certificate

Update your Nginx configuration to use the self-signed certificate. Modify your server block to include SSL settings:



http {
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name localhost;  # Use localhost if you are accessing it locally

        ssl_certificate /path/to/selfsigned.crt;  # Path to your self-signed certificate
        ssl_certificate_key /path/to/selfsigned.key;  # Path to your private key
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;  # Recommended protocols
        ssl_ciphers 'HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5';  # Recommended cipher suite

        location /stat {
            rtmp_stat all;
            rtmp_stat_stylesheet /styles/stat.xsl;
        }

        location /styles/ {
            alias /path/to/styles/;
        }
    }

    # Optional: HTTP server block to redirect to HTTPS
    server {
        listen 8080;
        server_name localhost;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

Step 3: Update Your Hosts File (If Needed)

If you are using a domain name other than localhost, update your hosts file to resolve the domain to your local IP address.
Step 4: Trust the Self-Signed Certificate (Optional)

To avoid security warnings in your browser when accessing your local HTTPS site, you can add the self-signed certificate to your system or browser's list of trusted certificates. This step varies by operating system and browser.
Step 5: Reload Nginx

After updating your configuration, reload Nginx to apply the changes:


sudo systemctl reload nginx

Step 6: Access the Stats Page

Now, you should be able to access your stats page over HTTPS by visiting https://localhost/stat or https://your-domain.com/stat in your browser. You might need to accept the security warning due to the use of a self-signed certificate.

make more efficient

o decrease the streaming delay on your local intranet when using Nginx as a streaming server with the RTMP module, you can consider the following adjustments to your Nginx configuration:

    Adjust the chunk_size:
        The chunk_size parameter determines the size of the chunks in which video is split before being sent to clients. A smaller chunk size can reduce delay, but it may increase CPU usage and network overhead. You might experiment with reducing this from the current setting of 4096 to see if it reduces the latency.

    Tweak buflen setting in RTMP:
        This setting isn't present in your configuration, but adding buflen can help control the delay. The buflen specifies the length of the buffer that Nginx uses to hold the video data before sending it. A smaller buffer can reduce latency.

    You can add it inside the application block like this:

    nginx

    application live {
        live on;
        record off;
        push rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/key;
        buflen 500ms;  # Reduces the buffer length
    }

    Fine-tuning VLC player settings:
        On the client-side, using VLC, you can also adjust the network caching settings. Reducing the caching value in VLC can decrease the latency when viewing the stream. This setting can be found in VLC under Tools → Preferences → Show settings (set to All) → Input / Codecs → Advanced → Network Caching (ms).

    Optimize TCP settings (if feasible):
        Enabling TCP options such as tcp_nodelay could theoretically reduce streaming latency by sending packets immediately rather than waiting for a full buffer. This isn't specific to RTMP or Nginx but can be considered if your stream traverses networks where TCP tuning is feasible.

    Network Infrastructure:
        Ensure that your network infrastructure (like switches and routers) is optimized for streaming media. Avoid network bottlenecks and ensure high-quality, low-latency network equipment.

    Update and Upgrade:
        Ensure that all your software, including Nginx and its RTMP module, are up-to-date. Sometimes performance improvements or bug fixes can help reduce latency.

    Monitoring and Logging:
        Enable logging and monitoring of your streaming setup to identify any potential bottlenecks or issues causing high latency. Nginx logs and network monitoring tools can provide insights into where delays are occurring.

Adjust these settings incrementally and monitor the impact on stream latency and server performance. Each environment is unique, so tuning these parameters may require some trial and error to find the optimal configuration.
